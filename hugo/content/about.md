Hey, my name is Alex H. Raber, I'm a thinker and tinkere, and self-taught cloud and devops engineer by trade. I have a passion for learning new technologies and bending them to solve unique and complex problems. I currently reside in the mountains near Bend, Oregon.

## I need some help, can I hire you?
I am currently **unavailable** for full-time work.

On occasion I take on side projects. If you have something interesting
for me to work on, reach out. Even if I can't participate, I might know someone who can.
